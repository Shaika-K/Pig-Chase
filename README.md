# Pig-Chase
Personal learning project to build a game using Processing


Pig Chase is another Processing project done in class.
It is an interactive game aimed at Children+.
The ultimate goal was to make it into a touch game for tablets and phones.

It is based on The 3 Little Pigs fairy tale by  James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps.

How to play and documentation are in the data folder and game.


Problems:
Lags in computers with small ram.
Speed is too slow.
Animations are too jerky.


Need to make it playable on tablet and phones.
